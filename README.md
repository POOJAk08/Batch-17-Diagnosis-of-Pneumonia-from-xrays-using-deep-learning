# Diagnosis of Pneumonia from X-rays using Deep learning

Pneumonia is a life-threatening infectious disease affecting one or both lungs in humans. 
Some of its symptoms appear include chest pain,difficulty breathing, excessive cough with phlegm.
Another infectious illness COVID-19, also known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus-2. 
This proposed system involves detection of the Pneumonia and COVID-19 based on deep learning using X-Ray images. 

Download Anaconda-Navigator and other necessary packages.

Steps to be followed to run the project:

Step 1:Open the ANACONDA-NAVIGATOR and create the required environment with necessary packages.
Step 2:Open the terminal and change the directory in which the source code is currently present.
Step 3:Execute the code using "python cnn_train_test.py".
Step 4:Initially the images are loaded and training is performed and then necessary metrics are generated.
Step 5:On Uploading the test x-ray image in the GUI,the test image is classified accordingly.
